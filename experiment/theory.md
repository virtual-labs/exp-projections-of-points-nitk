For a given point in a 3-D space, first, we should have measurements from the
data given and have an orthographic projection, following the conventions
properly.

Here basically, there are two measurements we must require for the projection of
point:

1.  The distance of a point from the vertical plane, the distance we observed
    from the top view.

2.  The distance of a point from the horizontal plane, distance observed from
    the front view.

X Y

So, this is the orthographic 2-D plane on which the measurements are
transferred. And now the next important part is a convention, which one has to
follow while drawing.

Convention:-

-   Top views are represented by only small letters eg. p*.*

-   Their front views are conventionally represented by small letters with
    dashes eg. p΄

-   Profile or side views are represented by small letters with double dashes
    eg. p΄΄

-   Projectors are shown as thin lines.

-   The line of intersection of HP and VP is denoted as X-Y.

-   The line of intersection of PP and VP is denoted as X1-Y1

-   Measurements of projectors should also be drawn by side.

  If we go for 3D space, it is divided into four quadrants. For every
  quadrant, there is a different orthographic projection.

-   First quadrant: Projection on VP will be represented above XY line and HP
    will be below.

-   Second quadrant: Projection on VP and HP both will be represented above XY
    line.

-   Third quadrant: Projection on VP will be represented below XY line and HP
    will go above.

-   Fourth quadrant: Projection on VP and HP both will go below XY line.

OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE

Point A is Placed In different quadrants and it’s Fv & Tv are brought in same
plane for Observer to see clearly. Fv is visible as it is a view on VP. But as
Tv is is a view on Hp, it is rotated downward 90 0 , In clockwise direction. The
In front part of Hp comes below xy line and the part behind Vp comes above.
Observe and note the process.
